## WordPress Theme or Plugin Development

WordPress is an open-source blogging and content management platform. It allows you to create and maintain everything from a small brochure site, a news or blog site, online store (eCommerce), corporate web presence or portfolio.

I can customise WordPress to meet nearly any need, whether that includes an online store or photo gallery or just a simple content focused website. Every website I create will be accessible, standards compliant, and social media and search engine friendly.

If you are interested in using WordPress for your next or existing website, do not hesitate to get into [contact](/contact) and I will see through discussion with you how I can best meet your needs. I can also extend your existing WordPress website if you are already using the platform.

## Custom Web Development

If your needs are not met by an existing solution, I can take your brief and develop a solution to meet your needs or that of your business. I may also be able to customise your existing custom solution so that it may continue to meet your needs.<sup>1</sup>

1. subject to approval, I will require access to the source code before commiting to the project.

## Design to HTML or Email

If you have had another designer create a design for you and need it converted to a content management, blog or forum template, static website or email template, I can take that design and turn it into code that will work across all major web browsers and email clients (if email template).

My code is standards compliant and accessible enabling you to engage with the widest possible audience and comply with local accessibility laws.
