## Custom Web Development

If your needs are not met by an existing solution, I can take your brief and develop a solution to meet your needs or that of your business. I may also be able to customise your existing custom solution so that it may continue to meet your needs.<sup>1</sup>

1. subject to approval, I will require access to the source code before commiting to the project.

## Design to HTML or Email

If you have had another designer create a design for you and need it converted to a content management, blog or forum template, static website or email template, I can take that design and turn it into code that will work across all major web browsers and email clients (if email template).

My code is standards compliant and accessible enabling you to engage with the widest possible audience and comply with local accessibility laws.
