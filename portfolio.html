Muse's Success is a structured wiki and community that is similar to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2659758-colette-snow">Goodreads</a> but exclusively for web fiction. While the software is specialised to web fiction, it could easily be adapted for other similar mediums such as web comics or video games.</p>
